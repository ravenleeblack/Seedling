// seeing as we already have tool and data types then use that flag somehow. Also need to be able to add the actual value of labels, and literals and
// we need to be able to identify which kind of literal we have. THe scope table does take string literals in right now but if we have a hex or num literal
// we will need to add in the real value?? maybe.

//So we already introduces num_ptr[index], fetch[index], and address[index] into the seedling assembler so we need to also add in mana_ptr[label_name] and
//func_ptr[label_name] that away there will already be native support in seedling before we build Illeshian backend. Also need to add in the support for
//log_ptr[log_name] and list_ptr[list_name]
