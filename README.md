Right now Seedling can:
- move 
- compare
- push and pop
- jump to labels
- call labels
- write to console
- read to console
- use system calls so it can probably do alot more

Currently working on opening, reading, and writing files. Still implementing and trying to figure out what all needs to be implemented.
