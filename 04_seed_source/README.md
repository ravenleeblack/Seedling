# Seedling Assembler - seed

The seedling program is named seed. It takes in .seed files and right is just a translator. It currently is producing nasm output so that we can
get it to assemble. Later once the language is buildt enough and has no errors I will write it to either produce machine code or nasm based off a 
flag. At least having it as a translator right now we can write the illeshian backend to output seedling and have it assemble that way for now.
