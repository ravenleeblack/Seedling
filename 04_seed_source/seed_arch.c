so I can have it for the re-write later. We want to set the arch first so that in later sections we can use it
to find the right sized registers and bytes. It should be cascading meaning that if we are in 64 then we have 64
bit options, 32 bit options, 16 bits options, and 8 bit options. If we are in 32 bit then we only have 32 bit, 
16 bit, and 8 bit options. If we are in 16 bit then 16 bit and 8 bit. 8 bit we only have 8 bit. The 8 bit im not
sure about yet but it does seem kind of cool to support so that we can use old code projects and have the option
to build 8 bit assembler and the likes from 8 bit and build up on it so that it makes it easier to learn things.*/
